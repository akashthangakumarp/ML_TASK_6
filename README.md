# 🎓 Online Education Student Performance & Risk Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **online education student data** and using **Machine Learning** techniques to understand and predict student **academic performance, engagement, dropout risk, and final results**.

The project explores different student-related factors such as education level, region, studied credits, online activity, average score, engagement level, performance level, and risk level.

The goal is to use data analysis and machine learning to identify students who may require additional academic support and to understand the factors associated with student success or withdrawal.

## 🤖 Machine Learning

Machine Learning techniques are applied to identify patterns in student data and predict student outcomes.

### 1. 📚 Student Performance Prediction

Predict the academic performance of students based on available academic and engagement-related features.

### 2. 🚨 Dropout Risk Prediction

Identify students who may have a higher probability of dropping out.

### 3. 🎓 Final Result Prediction

Predict the student's final outcome:

```text
Pass | Fail | Withdrawn | Distinction
```

### 4. ⚠️ Student Risk Analysis

Analyze student engagement and academic characteristics to categorize students according to their risk level.
